* TODO (close socket) Needs to be more final
  Adding additional watchers, especially timeouts, should not happen.
  Right now `$ echo DIE | nc localhost 4545` at examples/pingpong exposes
  this failure after a 30 second pause.

  The app is instrumented enough at the moment to make clear the failure:
  The data events are being fired, and the socket is being close before even
  the orignal connection event callback fires and the proper handlers are added.
  When the callback for the connection is fired a timer is started against a closed
  socket to watch for timeout, and the command and close handlers are registered. --
  This all happens on a closed socket. So in 30 seconds, the entire operation fails when
  the timer fires into a callback table of a thing that no longer exists. Good times.
